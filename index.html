<div>

<p> The Quark-Gluon Tomography (QGT) Collaboration, supported by the U.S. Dept of Energy Office of Nuclear Physics, brings together a team with broad
expertise and leadership across hadron physics theory, to drive understanding and discovery in the quark and
gluon tomography of hadrons and the origin of their mass and spin. Particular attention will be given to
generalized parton distribution functions. The collaboration has three main focus areas—theory, lattice QCD,
and global analysis/phenomenology—that work together to achieve the project goals.<p>
